Conductance Based Adaptive Exponential Integrate and Fire Model

This code allows to run simulations of Conductance Based Adaptive Exponential Integrate and Fire Neural Model (CADEX). CADEX model was created by Tomasz GÃ³rski and Damien Depannemaecker (equal contribution) and introduced in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/842823v1.

To run the code please install Python 3 and Brian2 Neural Simulator.
